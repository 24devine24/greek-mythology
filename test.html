    <b>dogs</b>
    <p>The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.</p>
    <div> Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior, leading to a large number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</div>
    <p>The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."</p>
    <div>Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds. In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes. </div>
    <p>there are many breeds of dogs like:</p>
    <li>the German Shepherd</li>
    <li>the Labrador Retriever</li>
    <li>the Pomeranian</li>
    <li>the Siberian Husky</li>
    <li>the Golden Retriever</li>
    <li>the Poodle</li>
    <li>the Bulldog</li>
    <li>the Shiba Inu</li>
    <li>the Chihuahua</li>
    <li>the Rottweiler</li>
    <li>the Dobermann</li>
    <li>the Shih Tzu</li>
    <li>the Dachshund and many more...</li>

    <p>Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years, and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour.<p>
